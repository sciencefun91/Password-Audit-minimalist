A Simple and Essential Website by Simone Pederzolli  
**Video Demo:** # TO DO....

## Description  
This final project involves developing a website dedicated to password security. I selected this topic because it represents a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity that is frequently overlooked despite its importance.

The website is fully responsive and has been tested on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices. The project folder contains:  
- Three HTML pages for the main site structure  
- A CSS file for styling and layout  
- A favicon and two images  

## Structure  

### Navigation Bar  
A fixed navigation bar at the top provides access to the three main sections: **Home**, **Tools**, and **Contact**.

### Home Page  
This section introduces the project's purpose and provides an overview. It explains the core functionality available in the Tools section, discusses common password mistakes, and concludes with key takeaways about password security.

### Security Tools (Core Functionality)  
This page contains two main interactive tools:  

1. **Password Compromise Check**  
   - Checks if a password has been exposed in known data breaches  
   - Uses the Have I Been Pwned API with k-anonymity for privacy protection  
   - Returns results indicating whether the password is safe or compromised  

2. **Secure Password Generator**  
   - Creates strong, customizable passwords with length options from 8 to 64 characters  
   - Offers four password types: Memorable, Letters & Numbers, Fully Random, and Numbers Only  
   - Includes a strength indicator that evaluates password security  

### Contact Page  
This section provides my contact information (email, phone, and address) along with an embedded Google Maps view of my location in Riva del Garda, Italy. A contact form allows visitors to send messages directly to my email.

## Technical Implementation  
The website uses:  
- HTML5 for structure  
- CSS3 with Bootstrap for responsive design  
- JavaScript for interactive functionality  
- External APIs (Have I Been Pwned) for password checking  

## Development Notes  
While the design prioritizes functionality over aesthetics, the core focus is on implementing practical security tools. During development, I used AI assistance to review code for errors and optimize performance, complementing my learning from CS50.

As a beginner in web development, this project represents my effort to create something both educational and practical in the field of cybersecurity.
